# PS-EcoPlugs

I decided to include my PowerShell code for Woods Wion (Eco-Plugs) smart outlet into my tools, why not share it with other people?
<br>
<br>
<b>What you will need:</b>
<br><i>* Note: The outlet cannot be on the cloud, it needs to be local.</i>
<br>
<br>1. Find the outlet's IP address and change the "<b>$Endpoint</b>" value.
<br>2. Find your Device ID (in the APP's settings) and changet the "<b>$DeviceID<b>" value.
<br>
<br><b>ENJOY!</b>
